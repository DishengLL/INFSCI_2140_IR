CMPINF 1205 COMPARATIVE DIGITAL PRIVACIES
This course will offer a broad survey of significant issues relating to privacy in the digital age. It investigates privacy in the digital world from cultural, social, communication, and policy perspectives. Taking a comparative approach, privacy related to digital communication is compared across several global regions in an attempt to understand the distinctiveness of privacy in those regions. The course will first introduce students to the concepts of privacy, the digital age, and the relation between privacy protections and the state. Students will understand the significance of the issue of digital privacies and why we need to employ a comparative approach to examine it.  The course will then look at selected case studies of digital privacy in several global regions, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and South East Asia. Issues related to digital privacies such as Internet laws and policies, media regulations and public interest, data protection, state control, and commercial interests in the digital age, surveillance, copyright, and privacy advocates will also be included.

CMPINF 2120 APPLIED PREDICTIVE MODELING
The ability to collect, store and process large amounts of detailed data in a variety of fields has led to a surge in the use of data in various decision making tasks, ranging from governmental policy making to drafting players in sports. Data literacy is thus important and in this first introductory course we will focus on shifting the traditional mode of deterministic (yes/no) thinking to probabilistic thinking. In this course, we will review concepts from applied probability and statistics and explore how they can be used in building a data-driven infrastructure with applications ranging from understanding a variety of everyday phenomena (e.g., descriptive modeling) to making decisions based on data (e.g., predictive modeling). In particular, we will focus on the principles and best practices in dealing with data, including understanding (a) the bias-variance tradeoff, (b) how to avoid overfitting, (c) how to choose the most appropriate model for your data and (d) how to evaluate your model's performance.   While the main focus of the course is on supervised learning, we will also introduce unsupervised learning and in particular the problem of clustering. We will also explore the concept of Monte Carlo simulations and resampling, and how they can be used to make predictions for systems that are too complicated to be solved in closed form. We will also provide an overview of analytical methods for specialized form of data including time series and relational data.

CS 1657 PRIVACY IN THE ELECTRONIC SOCIETY
Privacy is an increasingly significant concern in our modern, connected society. We all share personal information on a daily basis with a wide range of organizations. Although at times such sharing can be intentional and beneficial for the user, other times information is shared against the user's will, used for purposes that the user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to infer additional information that the user did not intend to reveal. In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing. Finally, students will learn about several privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and how these can be put to use by software developers to defend the privacy of their users.

The 2010 National Educational Technology Plan outlined how "The challenge for our education system is to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners." While instruction has traditionally been one-size-fits-all, the rise of web-based and mobile technologies provide an opportunity to automatically detect what learners need and adapt instruction to their unique prior knowledge, motivation, and preferences. In this seminar course, we survey different types of personalization in educational technologies (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, social, motivational), computational modeling techniques for representing learners and their needs, and best practices in designing personalized supports for learners. Students will lead one or more class discussions, participate in the other discussions, and complete a group course project.   Students must have a foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures before enrolling in this course.

Course Description: Many areas of social science--including sociology, psychology, and economics---traditionally rely on theory built from simplifying assumptions and supported by cumbersome random control trials. These methods have proven exceptionally useful, but small-scale controlled experiments often fail to generalize to broader populations and fail to make use of the today's data-rich world. Real-world social systems are comprised of complex interactions between key variables making them un-amenable to traditional analysis. Fortunately, the new field of Computational Social Science (CSS) has arisen to address this gap. Scientists in CSS tackle the most prominent questions about human-nature and society by leveraging rich data-sources, data-driven techniques, and new opportunities for large-scale experimentation. For example, instead of small-scale surveys, modern scientists are working with social media platforms to track the national spread of fake news, political ideology, and even flu symptoms. Using worker profiles from online job websites, CSS scientists are improving models of economic resilience to labor disruptions. Data from smart phones, geo-tagged tweets, and credit card transactions are yielding new insights into human mobility patterns and community access to goods, services, and opportunities. In this course, we will survey recent academic publications that use CSS techniques. Examples will come from all over social science, including economics, political science, sociology, demography, and transportation. Our goal is to understand how CSS expands complements traditional social science and where traditional social science techniques are actually more appropriate. This course will ask students to review research articles, and to prepare and lead discussions on the motivation, methods & data, results, and implications of the research.

LIS 2140 CRITICAL LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION PROFESSIONALS
Critical librarianship refers to the movement within libraries to reflect upon the libraries' role in hegemonic structures, and to empower community members to disrupt these systems. Critical librarianship is concerned with issues of social justice, intersectionality, privilege, power, and systems of oppression. It is influenced by critical race theory (CRT), queer theory, disability theory, intersectional feminist theory, and critical pedagogy, among others. In this course, we will explore how critical librarianship can allow us to interrogate the systems and structures of the library in order to seek justice in our communities.

This course introduces participants to "open data," a term that is assigned to data that are free to access and use, that are available in machine-readable formats, that can be reused for any purpose, and that can be modified and shared by others. Globally, we see conversations about open data in research, with growing expectations and requirements to share research data, and in government, with policies and initiatives to expand public access to datasets. This course will focus onThis second category of open data: data produced and shared by government and civic organizations. This course will overview the historical precedents to the open data movement, survey current policies at different levels of government, and examine key concepts in the open data movement. While we will focus on drivers and initiatives in the United States, we will look at case studies that will provide us with a broader understanding of what is happening worldwide.  The focus of this course will be the core information skills and principles that underpin the success of open data initiatives and the mechanisms and standards in which governments at all levels in the United States are employing to publish data.

LIS 2222 ARCHIVAL APPRAISAL, DESCRIPTION, AND ACCESS
This course is organized in three parts and will provide students with an introduction to the critical archival responsibilities of archival appraisal, description, and access. In the first section of the course, we will engage with archival appraisal. The archivist’s process in determining continuing value affects all other archival functions and impacts individual, organizational, and societal memory. Because of its significance for both archival work and society, appraisal has been the function most debated and subjected to experiments with new methodologies and theoretical models. This course will survey these models and, through an experiential project, delve deeply into one model in particular: documentation strategy. 1 Representing archival materials and providing access to them are core functions of the archival profession. Archivists do this with access systems that incorporate descriptive standards, data structures, controlled vocabularies, and increasingly, digital tools. The ways in which archives are described and represented influence the ways that users, such as historians, lawyers, and policymakers access, engage with, and understand the historical record. In the second section of this course, students will engage with archival descriptive standard and archival management systems, as well as debates and theories in the representation of information. Finally, we’ll consider strategies for raising the level of access for an archival collection, paying particular attention to the creation of digital exhibits.

LIS 2329 LITERACIES AND LIBRARIES
This course examines literacy instruction, promotion, and support for individuals and families according to the responsibilities and vantage point of the professional librarian. Most of the coursework focuses on public library, academic library, and school library contexts, including library services and outreach for immigrant communities and special populations (the latter as defined by ALA). Assignments and discussions can be differentiated to more specifically include literacy instruction opportunities in other library and information settings. Instructional methods include reading discussions and reflections, problem-based learning, and performance tasks.

Students are not expected to “be” a reading or writing teacher before, or following, their participation in this course, although learning objectives include developing an understanding of the stages and development of reading in order to inform work that librarians are qualified to do. Teaching reading to children, young adults, and/or adults is a specialized profession, and the requisite, in-depth skill development and practicum experience (student teaching/internship/clinical) are outside the scope of this course. Our purview in the literacy arena does, however, include planning literacy-focused programs and events and selecting and applying strategies to teach or facilitate reading and reading instruction in the library. These competencies include readers advisory and bibliotherapy; modeling, teaching, and guiding information literacy skills and additional forms of literacy; and supporting students’ or patrons’ literacy needs in digital texts, multimedia, and e-reading. Students will read and discuss research on reading, literacies, and reading instruction, and study the work and resources of professional organizations involved in reading and literacies and guiding information literacy skills and additional forms of literacy; and supporting students’ or patrons’ literacy needs in digital texts, multimedia, and e-reading. Students will read and discuss research on reading, literacies, and reading instruction, and study the work and resources of professional organizations involved in reading and literacies

LIS 2674 PRESERVING DIGITAL CULTURE
This course is divided into two sections. First, we delve into fundamental concepts and principles of digital preservation, studying what the Library of Congress's Trevor Owens terms "the theory and craft of digital preservation." We will consider standards, strategies, and tools that librarians, archivists, data curators, and information professionals broadly employ to ensure long term availability of digital materials. We will view digital preservation as a spectrum, using the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's (NDSA)"Levels of Digital Preservation" as a means to understand the ways that and the extent to which an organization may implement a preservation strategy. The NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation will serve as a framing for our discussions on file formats, storage and repositories, and file fixity. This first section of the course will involve lectures, discussion, and tool labs. In the second section, we will conduct a deep dive into complex digital object types and probe the strategies, systems, and ethical/legal issues surrounding the curation of this sample of materials: social media, websites, email, and software.

Class name: Technology infrastructures: Smart City technologies and their governance

Description: Smart cities have emerged as a technologically oriented approach to facilitate urban living.  The term “smart city” has come to incorporate many different goals, concepts, technologies and ideas.  In this course, we begin by studying some conceptual foundations, including the economic and social aspects of infrastructure, contemporary ideas about governmental efficiency, and the notion of 4th industrial revolution technologies.  We then systematically apply these theories to successful and unsuccessful examples of smart city deployment. To cultivate students’ analysis ability, the case studies are conducted using major qualitative research methodologies that forms the basis of social science research. After taking the theories belonging to the qualitative methodology, students can understand the differences between quantitative research through the process of repeating individual or small group practice, and accurately understand the merits and limitation of qualitative research methodology and apply them.

This course offers a unique opportunity.  It will be in online-only format since it is team taught by Prof. Junseok Hwang of Seoul National University (Korea) and Prof. Martin Weiss (SCI) as a synchronous course.  Students in the course will work on project teams across these two institutions and will have the benefit of multiple perspectives on this complex topic.
